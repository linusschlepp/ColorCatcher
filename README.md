### Watch out its raining colored stars, rhombuses and rectangles!! 

ColorCatcher is a simple game... The point of this game is to move from left to right and catch objects, of which the color
corresponds to the color of the player. 

At first glance this sounds simple, but it can be tricky as the color of the player changes at random. Furthermore,
the objects have different movement patterns and the falling speed of those objects is increasing as the player makes points. 

**So watch out, catch the correct colors or lose!**
